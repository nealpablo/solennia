      <p><strong>Acceptance of Terms</strong><br>
        Welcome to Solennia. By accessing or using our website, mobile application, or any services provided through our platform, you agree to be bound by the following Terms and Conditions. Please read them carefully. If you do not agree with these terms, you must refrain from using our platform.

      <p><strong>About Solennia</strong><br>
        Solennia is a digital platform designed to connect couples planning their weddings with professional vendors offering relevant services. These services may include, but are not limited to, venue rentals, catering, photography, floral design, gown rentals, and entertainment. Our goal is to simplify and personalize the wedding planning experience through smart tools, including our AI-based wedding assistant.
      </p>
      <p><strong>User Accounts & Vendor Content</strong><br>
        All users—whether couples or vendors—must provide accurate and truthful information during registration. Vendors are responsible for ensuring that the content they submit, including photos, descriptions, and business information, is lawful, not misleading, and does not infringe on any third-party rights. Solennia reserves the right to verify, approve, or reject listings that do not meet quality standards or violate our policies.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Role as Intermediary</strong><br>
        Users understand that Solennia acts only as an intermediary between clients and vendors. While we facilitate the discovery and connection process, Solennia is not responsible for any agreements, disputes, payments, or service outcomes between the two parties. All bookings, negotiations, and final arrangements are handled directly by the user and vendor. Solennia is not liable for any damages, losses, or service failures resulting from interactions on the platform.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Vendor Responsibilities</strong><br>
        Vendors who apply to be listed on Solennia agree to be professional, responsive, and transparent in their communications and services. They must not engage in fraudulent, abusive, or unethical behavior. Solennia may suspend or terminate accounts that violate our community standards or receive repeated complaints.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Privacy</strong><br>
        Solennia respects user privacy and data security. All information collected is handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy. By using the platform, you consent to the collection and use of your information as outlined in that policy.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Changes to Terms</strong><br>
        We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms and Conditions at any time without prior notice. Changes will be effective upon posting on the website or app. Continued use of Solennia after such changes indicates your acceptance of the updated terms.

        By applying to become a vendor on Solennia, you agree to the following terms and conditions. Solennia is a wedding planning platform that helps couples connect with trusted service providers like you. Participation on the platform is entirely voluntary, and by submitting your application, you acknowledge that your inclusion is subject to review and approval by the Solennia team. Approval is not guaranteed, and Solennia reserves the right to accept or decline any vendor based on quality, authenticity, and service alignment.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a vendor, you are responsible for providing accurate and up-to-date information about your business, including your services, pricing, photos, and availability. You agree to respond to client inquiries in a timely manner and to provide professional and reliable service to all clients connected through the platform. You confirm that all content you upload (such as images, logos, and testimonials) is either owned by you or you have full rights to use it. By listing with Solennia, you grant the platform permission to display your business profile and media across the platform, in marketing materials, or on social channels, to promote your services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, listing your services on Solennia is free of charge. If any fees, subscriptions, or commission-based models are introduced in the future, you will be notified in advance and given the option to continue or withdraw from the platform. You are free to request updates to your profile or ask for removal at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Solennia acts only as a facilitator between clients and vendors. We do not control or guarantee the outcome of any agreements, bookings, or payments between you and your clients. Therefore, you are solely responsible for your transactions, communication, and the quality of services delivered. Solennia will not be held liable for any disputes, damages, or losses arising from these interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Solennia reserves the right to remove any vendor from the platform at any time if false or misleading information is found, if there are repeated client complaints, or if there is a breach of professionalism or trust. Inactivity or unresponsiveness may also lead to removal.

        We are committed to respecting your privacy. Any data you share will be handled according to our Privacy Policy and will not be sold or distributed without your consent.
